# FleetWatcher

FleetWatcher Mobile is the iOS application for customers of [EarthWave Technologies](http://www.earthwavetech.com) to access and moitor their assets on the go.

FleetWatcher is a GPS fleet management system that helps you make better decisions regarding fleet utilization, productivity, and efficiency. The larger your fleet, the more difficult it is to keep track of all of your equipment. With equipment needing to be moved from work site to work site and the number of worksites always changing, keeping track of where each piece of equipment is can become a full-time job, unless you have a GPS fleet tracking system like FleetWatcher installed.
