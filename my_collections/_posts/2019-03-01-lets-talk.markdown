How much money are yall gonne give me?

for real! like how much yall got? huh?

`$100/hr`?

`$120/hr`?

`$300/hr`?

`$1000/hr`?

I'm worth alot! like so much!
I am.
seriously.

I also offer powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight swift %}
struct Wallet {
	var amount:Float
	mutating func getFatter(_ amount:Float) {
		self.amount += amount
	}
}

// heres my wallet.

// I've got a 5 dollar bill in my wallet.
var myWallet = Wallet(amount: 5.00)

// What I'm looking for in this job is something like this:
myWallet.getFatter(Float.max)

print("Im Finally HAPPY! \(myWallet.amount)")
{% endhighlight %}
