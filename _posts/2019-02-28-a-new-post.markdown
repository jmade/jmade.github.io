You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Some swift code will be here **soon.**

###Holy Shit!
* This is cool!
* jekyll Rulez

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight swift %}
let someSwiftCode = SwiftCode()
print("Swift Code: \(someSwiftCode)")
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
