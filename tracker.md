# Tracker

The Tracker app is a project I made to help understand and utilize The `CoreLocation` and `CoreMotion` frameworks. 

I initially created a simple server and the device would send data to the sever configured on intervals. 

This project helped me build a few wrapper objects that makes it easier to access the kind of info wanted from each system. 


***Note**: the server has since been taken down.*
