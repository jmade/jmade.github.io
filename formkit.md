## About

This is a *Static Library* created as tool for a recent project I worked on.

FormKit Uses the [DeepDiff](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff) library from [onmyway133](https://onmyway133.github.io/) to provide smooth system animations. 

Also uses a **Micro Library** for creating and handling custom presentations
